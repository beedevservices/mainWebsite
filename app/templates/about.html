        <p>I have always had a love of art and creating things.  After serving in the US Navy for 11 years I left the service to become a stay at home Mom.  With my family spread across the US I wanted a way to show my family my kids growing up.  So I started learning how to build a website.  Over 10 years later I am still coding and building websites and loving every minuet.</p>
        <p>After hours of research and several online classes I built my 1st website for a local photographer and found that helping her get her name out there and a place for her to showcase her talents was something I was enjoyed.  After enrolling in an immersive online Full Stack Web Developer school and learning how much more there is to Web Development my desire to help others grew. Now I build websites for others and teach new Developers at <a href="https://codingdojo.com" target="_blank">Coding Dojo</a></p>
