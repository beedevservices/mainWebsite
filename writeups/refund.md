Refund Policy
All web design services or subscribing to our hosting services at https://beedev-services.com operated by Melissa Longenberger.

We do not offer refunds. All sales are considered final. Once you have paid me it’s because you are 100% satisfied with the work I’ve done.

Due to the nature of our business, unfortunately, there is no effective way for us to issue refunds.

We will be happy to answer questions regarding our products before your purchase to ensure it will meet your needs. Thank you for your understanding.

If you have any additional questions feel free to contact me.
